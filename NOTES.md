JonathanGian: can you explain whats going on in the backend?

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationThe backend is a NestJS application that uses environment configuration (like the settings in your .env.local) to integrate with external services. Here’s a quick breakdown:

- **Supabase Integration:**  
  The app uses Supabase for database access, authentication, and storage. Environment variables (such as SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY) are loaded and used by services like `SupabaseService` to interact with your PostgreSQL database and storage.

- **Configuration & Environment:**  
  The configuration (via [@nestjs/config](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/configuration)) reads settings from .env files. This includes the server port, allowed CORS origins, and links for both the backend and frontend (VITE_API_URL).

- **Global Exception Handling:**  
  In `main.ts`, the application sets up a global exception filter (using `AllExceptionsFilter`) to standardize error responses.

- **CORS Setup:**  
  The backend enables CORS using origins specified by ALLOWED_ORIGINS from the env file, ensuring that only trusted client URLs can access the API.

- **Additional Integrations:**  
  Other configurations include S3 for file storage (used for item images) and email setup (with Gmail credentials) for sending notifications.

This structure provides a modular and secure backend with external integrations managed via environment variables and organized using NestJS’s modules, controllers, and services.

JonathanGian: Read all the files in the backend and tell me what are the main functions of each service

GitHub Copilot: Below is a summary of the main functions provided by each backend service in your NestJS application:

- **BookingService** (booking.service.ts)  
  – Handles the full lifecycle of a booking (order).  
  – Retrieves all orders or bookings for a user.  
  – Creates, updates, cancels, confirms, or rejects a booking.  
  – Manages the return of items (including status updates and email notifications).  
  – Checks item availability and confirms pickup.  
  – Integrates with the MailService to notify users (e.g. send rejection or return emails).

- **SupabaseService** (supabase.service.ts)  
  – Manages connections to your Supabase database.  
  – Provides methods to get different clients (service client with admin privileges and anon client for regular user operations).  
  – Centralizes database access so that other services can perform queries using the appropriate credentials.

- **StorageItemsService** (storage-items.service.ts)  
  – Manages CRUD operations for storage items.  
  – Retrieves complete item details (including joining with related tags and storage locations).  
  – Handles item creation, updating, and soft deletion, including querying by tag.

- **S3Service** (s3-supabase.service.ts)  
  – Wraps S3 file storage operations against a Supabase S3-compatible endpoint.  
  – Provides methods for uploading and deleting files from the bucket.  
  – Returns the base public URL for accessing files stored within the bucket.

- **LogsService** (logs.service.ts)  
  – Manages system logging and audit logging.  
  – Retrieves audit logs from the database and combines them with in-memory system logs.  
  – Formats and categorizes log messages (error, warning, info, debug) and ensures that only authorized (admin) users can access logs.

- **MailService** (mail.service.ts)  
  – Responsible for all email communications within the system.  
  – Sends various notifications (e.g. booking rejection, deletion, items returned, items picked up) with appropriate email templates.

- **InvoiceService** (invoice.service.ts)  
  – Likely handles the creation and management of invoices related to bookings or orders.  
  – Integrates with the booking processes to generate billing or invoice information when needed.

Other services (such as those for users, tags, item images, and storage locations) play supporting roles:
- **UserService** manages user-related operations.  
- **TagService** works with tags associated with storage items.  
- **ItemImagesService** handles image uploads and linking images with storage items.  
- **StorageLocationsService** manages data related to where items are stored.

Each service is designed to encapsulate a specific set of responsibilities in your app’s domain, and they work together using NestJS's dependency injection system to keep the code modular and maintainable.

   - **Steps:**  
     - Validates that a user ID is present in the DTO.  
     - Loops through each item in the booking to:  
       - Validate that the start date is at least one day in the future and check for short-notice warnings.  
       - Check both virtual availability (via `calculateAvailableQuantity`) and physical stock from the "storage_items" table.  
     - Generates a unique order number.  
     - Inserts a new order record into the "orders" table.  
     - For each item, fetches its location and then inserts a respective order item into the "order_items" table.

### Suggestions for Splitting Down the File


   
1. **Modularize Role and Permission Checks:**
   - Encapsulate permission and role validation in a middleware or a separate authorization service. This can make each function cleaner and free from repetitive role-check code.
   
2. **Use DTOs and Validation Classes:**
   - Utilize Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and validation pipes to handle incoming data validations, which could further reduce the amount of inline error checking in each method.

3. **Use Enums for Statuses:**
   - Define enums for status values to make the code more readable and maintainable. For example, use `enum PaymentStatus { INVOICE_SENT, PAID, PAYMENT_REJECTED, OVERDUE }`.

4. **Enrich Items**
   **Issue**
   - Same 4-line block to “enrich” items appears in 7 different methods.
   **Solution**
   - Make it into its own service or private helper function. This will reduce the amount of duplicate code and make the code easier to maintain.



# Backend Suggestions

1. **Request**
    - Instead of creating a new Supabase Client every time you call a function, use middleware to create a single client instance and reuse it across all functions.
    - Also type the request to get rid of the use of the **any** type.


    
# Suggestions for BookingService

1. **getAllOrders**
    - instead of creating the Supabase Client every time you call a function, use middleware to create a single client instance and reuse it across all functions.
    - userId is a parameter but is never used in the function.
    

## Bugs

- User can approve bookings.
- `x-user-id` can easily be spoofed to grant anyone super admin privileges.
- User can confirm orders.
- Why is there a confirm order and also a confirm for pickup, but the confirm for pickup didnt seem to change the row in the orders table?
